#### Passionate Software Engineer | Enhancing Developer Productivity | Embracing Low-Level Programming Challenges

As a software engineer often described as a "Jack of all trades," my expertise spans a diverse range of programming languages, including q, C, Go, GLSL, and Python. My passion for coding extends into my arguably excessive hobby harboring several personal projects, my current focus being on "keyb" - a PowerToy-AutoHotKey hybrid tool designed to supercharge developer productivity on Windows.

## Professional Milestones:

- Developed a dockerized test environment deployment tool at KX that reduces hours of setup seconds. This significantly accelerated all team members ability to test and iterate on new features.

- Quickly ramped up on an unfamiliar C codebase to tackle critical memory allocation and leak issues, enhancing system stability and alleviating team stress under tight deadlines.

## Academic and Niche Projects:

- At university, I worked on control systems for experimental Quantum Optics setups using FPGAs and Arduino, blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

- Tackled programming in YOLOL for [the ISAN project](https://github.com/Collective-SB/ISAN), an environment that challenges traditional programming methods with its unique code-golf-esque constraints.

- Tinkered with custom hardware & firmware design, building [a custom PCB](https://github.com/Azurethi/Unix-clock) featuring four 4x8 segment displays, an ATMEGA328P & shift registers for IO expansion to show the current time in Unix timestamp format

- Developed "[Ardunode](https://github.com/Azurethi/Ardunode)," a Node.js module, leverages serialport to introduce a developer-friendly, packet-based protocol for easier communication with serial devices.

## My Approach:
As a self-proclaimed 'professionally lazy' innovator, my driving force is to automate the mundane, opening doors to new and interesting challenges. I'm driven to create tools that not only streamline complex tasks but also amplify satisfaction and productivity for myself and others. Transforming caffeine and a healthy aversion to repetitive tasks into coding efficiency gold. With a constant thirst for learning and innovation, I ensure that my solutions are elegantly efficient while keeping the coding journey enjoyable and engaging.
